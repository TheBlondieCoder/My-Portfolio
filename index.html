    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      I was a massage therapist for 4 Years. I have been studying Web
      development for Almost two years. I decided to get into Web development
      because I wanted to be in a more creative field. I wanted to do something
      that would challenge me more and also make it so I could do more with my
      mind. I love playing video games and as a future goal I am hoping to one
      day make a small game just for fun. I also would like to make a few apps
      for fun. and maybe even make an app that will help people. As I continue
      to update this page , I will most likely update my goals as well.
